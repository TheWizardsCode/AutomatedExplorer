This is a complex piece of software that has many parameters that need tuning to get things "just right". It's also in active development and as such there is likely lots of gaps in the documentation. Note that most parameters have a tooltip to give you a clue as to their purpose. Please help us by submitting improvements to this documentation. To help you get started we welcome questions on our discord at https://discord.gg/mm8FNGFsCq 

# Examples

Below are some example configurations, in a rough order of complexity. We recommend you work through them in order. Many of these require one more more asset purchasses, but the instructions will still be hepful even if you are using another model. Required assets are listed below. Note, the links are affiliate links, we'd appreciate you clicking any one them as it costs you nothing but means we get a small cut of any asset purchases you make (even if not the asset visited):

  * [Fly Cam](flyCam.md) - no additional assets required
  * [Butterfly](butterfly.md) - using [Bird Flock](http://bit.ly/BirdFlock)
  * [Unka The Dragon](unka.md) - using [Unka the Dragon](https://bit.ly/UnkaTheDragon)
